SIBLINGs (SIB Large INtercomparison of Genomes) project aims to provide the bioinformatics community with precomputed inter- and intra- genome homology searches, i.e. &quot;all-against-all&quot; gene comparisons from complete genomes. Such datasets of homologous gene relations can be further processed for identifying gene families, e.g. for phylogenetic studies, as well as for identifying paralogs and orthologs.

The SIBLINGs project is supported by SIB and it is aimed at unifying the &quot;common denominator&quot; of data processing for OrthoDB and OMA that requires substantial efforts for data preparation and CPU processing time.
